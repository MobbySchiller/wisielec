## General info
Hangman is a word party game. Your goal is to guess words based on its category and length. You guess the word by selecting a single letter which is checked. If the letter appears in a word, you are informed of the place where the letter appears. In the absence of a letter, a dash by dash is built. Guess the words and get satisfaction, just be careful not to hang.
